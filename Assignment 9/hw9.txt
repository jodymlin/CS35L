Assignment 9
Homework
--------------

1)

I created this file hw9.txt to log each step of the homework:

  $ emacs hw9.txt

2)

To check out version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repository into
a new branch named "quote", I ran:

  $ cd diffutils
  $ git checkout v3.0 -b quote
  M src/cmp.c
  M src/diff.c
  M src/diff3.c
  M src/dir.c
  M src/sdiff.c
  M src/util.c
  Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3) 

I installed my change into this new branch by running:

  $ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

The patch seemed to be applied without any errors.

4)

I learned how to use the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window.

C-x 4 a : adds a new entry to the change log file for the file
      	  you are editing

5)

I composed an appropiate ChangeLog entry for my patch by adapting
the change log from the quote-patch.txt using the
add-change-log-entry-other-window Emacs function:

  $ emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt
  C-x 4 a

        * quote-3.0-patch.txt: This patch was created in response
        to a recent change in the GNU coding standards, which now
        suggests quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
        `like this' or ``like this". Note that these changes are
        only applied to character string constants in .c files.

  C-x C-s
  C-x C-c

6)

I then committed my changes to the new branch using the ChangeLog
entry as the commit message:

  $ mv quote-3.0-patch.txt ..
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -F ChangeLog

7)

I then generated a new patch file that should work without having
to fix things by hand afterwards:

  $ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8)

Next, my partner and I exchanged patches through email for testing.
I moved this file onto the SEASnet server and into diffutils.
To verify that my partner's patch works, I checked out version 3.0
again into a new temporary branch and applied her patch:

  $ git checkout v3.0 -b quote-2
  $ git am < nikki-formatted-patch.txt
  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check

As before, I recieved no error, along with a message telling me that
all 88 tests successfully passed!

I tested the following commands again:

  $ src/diff . -
  src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

  $ src/diff --help
  
Examining the lengthy output for lines that are supposed to contain
' instead of `, I could see that the patch was successful! Here
are a few examples:

  LTYPE is 'old', 'new', or 'unchanged'.  GTYPE is LTYPE or 'changed'.

  -l  --paginate  Pass the output through 'pr' to paginate it.

  FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.

  If a FILE is '-', read standard input.

9)

To verify that my ChangeLog entry works, I ran:

  $ make distdir

A new directory called diffutils-3.0.1-ac41 was created! I opened
the directory and examined the ChangeLog file inside:

  $ cd diffutils-3.0.1-ac41
  $ emacs ChangeLog

I could see that my partner's ChangeLog entry was at the top of the
file, so we know that the ChangeLog entries worked.

10)

I logged out of the SEASnet server and logged back in using the -X
flag to enable X forwarding:

  $ ssh -X kathy@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

I then went into the directory containing the copy of the GNU
Emacs git repository's master branch and ran gitk on it:

  $ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
  $ gitk

A window popped up soon after in XQuartz containing the repository.
I scrolled down the long list of commits to find the newest merge
that is no newer than 2015-01-25.
