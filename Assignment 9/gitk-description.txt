The top left window details each commit (including the commit messages)
while also revealing the heirarchy of branches that have come from the
master branch. They are also listed in chronological order from the 
most recent commits being at the top to the oldest commits being towards
the bottom.

The top middle window details the name and email of each person that
made the corresponding commit while the top right window details the
exact date and time that the commit was done.

Underneath all 3 windows in the center is a section that shows which row
out of the total number of rows/commits you are currently viewing. For
example, in the screenshot I took, I was viewing commit 14999 out of
135143 total commits.

The bottom left window shows more details about the commit, including the
author, the ChangeLog message, and all the changes in diff format. If
it was just a merge action to master as it was in the screenshot, it
merely tells us it was a merge commit with no other changes listed.

The bottom right window lists the files that were changed in the commit
of interest. In the screenshot I took, there were no files listed since
it was a merge commit, but it other commits with file changes, there
are 1 or more files listed.
